		<h3>My Trip To California</h3><br/>
		<p align='justify'>
			It was a long quick trip. We loaded our vehicle and headed to Northern Califronia for the 
			4th of July weekend for a family reunion. We then made haste to Magic Mountain.
			By the time we reutrned home, we have travelled some 1,300 miles in three and one half days.

		<h3>My trip top the Rockies</h3><br/>
		<p align='justify'>
		After a year's preparation, it was time to go backpacking with the Boy Scouts. 
		We flew to Colorado Springs, toured the Air Force Academy, Pike's Peak, Garden of the Gods, 
		and the Olympic training center. We chartered a bus to the Philmont Scout Ranch in Northern
		New Mexico and began our 60 mile backpack trek. Afterwards, we boarded Amtrack's and rode 
		the rails to Kingsman, and then chartered a bus home.

		<h3>My trip to the Mid West</h3><br/>
		<p align='justify'>
		My wife and I drove our son's little red Ford Mustang 2,900 miles to him in Indiana
		where he attends college. In route, we stopped at Nauvoo, Illinois, and Detroit, Michigan. 
		We then boarded Amtrak in Chicago, and rode it to Salt Lake City, where we boarded a bus
		which returned us to Las Vegas.
